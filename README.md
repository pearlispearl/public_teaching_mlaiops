# ITCS355 Lab 1 — Reproducible Training

Predicting machine failure within 7 days from sensor readings. The model is not the point;
whether a stranger can reproduce it is.

> **This README is graded.** A grader with Docker and nothing else from your setup runs one
> command and compares the result against the claim below. Edit every `<...>` and delete the
> instruction blocks marked REPLACE  before submitting.

## Reproduce

```bash
make reproduce
```

expected test_roc_auc: 0.848 ± 0.010

Runtime: about 40 seconds on 4 cores. No cloud account or credentials needed for this command —
that is deliberate, and it is why a grader can run it.

---

## The problem

240 machines, 25 readings each, 6 sensor features, binary target `failed_within_7d` with a
positive rate near 12%.

Machines have persistent characteristics — a hot-running machine reads hot in every row. So the
train/validation/test split is **grouped by `machine_id`**: every reading from one machine lands
in exactly one partition. Splitting row-wise instead lets the model memorise the machine and
reports a validation score that will never survive production. `tests/test_data.py` asserts this
property holds, and Lab 4 turns it into a CI gate.

Bringing your own dataset is allowed. Replace `scripts/make_dataset.py`, update the schema in
`src/data.py`, and keep every test passing.

---

## Layout

```
src/          Layer 1 — provider-neutral. No SDKs, no bucket names, no absolute paths.
cloudlayer/   Layer 3 — the only place a provider SDK may be imported.
scripts/      Dataset generation, cloud check, portability audit, metric verification.
tests/        Data contract tests and split property tests.
```

`src/config.py` is the single point of environment knowledge. Everything else reads from it.
`make portability-audit` enforces the rule; it fails the build if a provider string appears in
`src/` or `tests/`.

---

## Setup

```bash
cp cloud.env.example cloud.env      # fill in, never commit
make setup
make cloud-check                    # eight slots, all PASS
make data                           # generate the dataset
make test                           # 10 tests, all passing
```

Post your `make cloud-check` output in the course channel before Session 1.

## What you must finish

Four `TODO` markers are left in the repo deliberately. Each is a graded decision, not busywork.

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| `requirements.txt` | Regenerate with `pip-compile --generate-hashes` |
| `Dockerfile` | Pin the base image by digest; add `--require-hashes` |
| `cloudlayer/gcp.py` | Implement `upload`, `download`, `push_image` |
| This README | The reproducibility trade-off question below |

Then:

```bash
make image-push        # image reaches your registry, digest-pinned
dvc init && dvc remote add -d storage ${BLOB_URI}/dvc
dvc add data/raw && dvc push
```

Run five or more tracked runs varying something meaningful — not five identical runs with
different seeds.

---

## Reproducibility trade-off

Under time pressure, I would drop seed control first. In my own runs, fixing the seed reproduces test ROC AUC within 0.0002 of the claimed value, 
but sweeping the seed across three runs moved it from 0.8240 to 0.8482, a spread of about 0.024. So dropping seed control costs comparability between
runs, not buildability. I'd keep an unhashed dependency which could silently pull a tampered package, and a moving base-image tag can break the build 
overnight with zero code change on my part.
---

## Notes for the grader

**Tolerance scope.** The ±0.010 in the claim line covers fixed-seed
reproducibility across machines/architectures, what `make reproduce`
actually exercises. It does not cover seed sensitivity: varying the seed
across three otherwise-identical runs moved test_roc_auc from 0.8482 to
0.8240 (spread ≈ 0.248), because the seed also determines the machine-level
split, not just the model's internal randomness. Both numbers are correct,
they answer different questions.

**Platform warning during `make reproduce`.** On Apple Silicon you'll see
`WARNING: the requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the
detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8)`. This is expected, the image is
built for linux/amd64 on purpose per the lab spec, and Docker Desktop runs it
under emulation. It is not a build error.

**git_commit provenance.** The runtime image intentionally has no `.git`
directory and no `git` binary, the commit SHA is injected at build time via
`--build-arg GIT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD)` (see Makefile `image` target)
and read from an environment variable at runtime, not queried live. This is
why `src/train.py`'s `git_commit()` is a one-line env lookup rather than a
subprocess call.

## Checklist before you submit

- [ ] `make reproduce` works from a fresh clone, on a machine that is not yours
- [ ] `make verify` passes against your claim line
- [ ] `make test` — all tests pass
- [ ] `make portability-audit` — clean
- [ ] Image builds for `linux/amd64` and is pushed, digest-pinned
- [ ] `dvc push` completed; a grader can `dvc pull`
- [ ] Five or more tracked runs with params, metrics, data fingerprint, and commit SHA
- [ ] Every REPLACE  block above is gone (the course-materials block at the top stays)
- [ ] `git log -p | grep -i -E "secret|password|AKIA|BEGIN PRIVATE"` returns nothing

That last check is not optional. A credential in Git history is an automatic deduction in this
course, and rotating it is your responsibility, not the grader's.
